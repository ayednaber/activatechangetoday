            <p>I am originally from the United Kingdom where I was a police officer for 10 years. I emigrated to Canada in 2003. I became interested
                in hypnotherapy when I became fearful of flying. I received a couple of EFT sessions (Emotional Freedom technique, commonly known as tapping) and a
                hypnotherapy session. After 3 sessions, I got back on a plane after swearing I would never fly again. That particular flight was surreal and
                encouraged me to train in EFT and hypnotherapy.
